### Procedure

There are two parts in this experiment
<br>
1. Demo
2. Simulation

The tasks in Demo are self explanatory. There are three tasks in Simulation.
<br>
<br>

**Procedure for Encoding:**
* First enter a binary message and click on <b>Submit</b>.
* The entered message will be displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
* Encode the message using the given convolutional encoder and click on <b>Submit</b>.
*  The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
*  If the answer is correct, click on <b>Reset</b> to try these steps again with a different binary message.
---
**Procedure for State Diagram:**
* Enter the next state and output values in the respective fields and click on <b>Submit</b>.
*  The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
* If the entered answer is correct, the state diagram gets updated and the <b>Next</b> button gets enabled.
*  Click on <b>Next</b> to answer the next question.
*  Repeat the same procedure and answer all the questions until the state diagram is complete.

**Procedure for Viterbi Decoding:**
* First enter values in all the four fields. The values can be 0, 1 or &infin;. Type 'in' if the value is &infin;.
*  Then, select the four paths with the least path metric by clicking on four lines. The line changes its opacity when clicked. When the line's opacity is dark, it indicates that the line is currently selected, whereas if it is transparent, it indicates that the line is not selected. Click exactly on the line to select it. Clicking in the vicinity will not work.
* After entering the four values and selecting the four paths click on <b>Submit</b>.
* The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
*  If the answer is correct, proceed to the next state and repeat the process.
* After correctly entering the path metrics and choosing the paths for all the five stages, a message stating that forward tracing is completed will be displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
* Then, starting from the state with the least path metric, trace back along the path from right to left by clicking on the lines. Clicking on a path changes its color to
black indicating that it has been selected.
* After selecting the path, click on <b>Submit</b>.
* The correctness of the entered answer is displayed in <b>Observations</b>.
