# Aim 
In this experiment, we will introduce a new family of error correcting codes, namely convolutional codes. The aim of this experiment is to introduce students with convolutional codes and their decoding via Viterbi algorithm. Students will learn the encoding of convolutional codes using shift registers. They will understand the concept of state diagram and trellis diagram of a convolutional code. Finally, decoding of convolutional codes using the Viterbi algorithm will be illustrated.

The structure of the experiment is as follows:
- Encoding
- State Diagram
- Viterbi Decoding
